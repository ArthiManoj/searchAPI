Goals of the Project:

searchAPI

1.Write a test plan for the documented iTunes Search API

Link for document: https://github.com/iappsqainterview/searchAPI/blob/master/API.md

2.Write Java automation that will make requests to this API:
Include TestNG or JUnit classes with validations for the documented functional test cases

Tools Used:

Java: Programming language
JUnit: Unit testing framework for java
Git: To save and manage test scripts on version updates and changes.
Maven: Build automation tool primarily used for java projects.It describes how software is built and its dependencies.
JUnit SureFire: Used to generate test reports where team members can act accordingly.
Eclipse IDE for developing the Framework
JSON libraries

Test Cases:

1. Test if the response contains given parameter key value pair as {"artistName":"Alicia keys"} matches in all the results
   - Pass the url : url1=https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=alicia from the property file to the test function
   - Get JSON response and store it in a array
   - Parse through the array to find if  {"artistName":"Alicia keys"} contains in all the indexes of the array
   - Assert if true on each iteration. If false report failure.
   Expected : Test Failure 
   
2. Test if the result count is 0 , when the parameter key 'Term' is not added in the url
   - Pass the url : url2=https://itunes.apple.com/search?country=US&media=music&limit=10
   - Assert if array length is 0. If greater than 0 report failure.
   Expected : Test Passed  
   
3.Test if all parameter key and value pairs match
   - Pass the url : url3=https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=zootopia&country=US&media=movie&limit=1
   - Get JSON response and store it in a array
   - Parse through the array to find if  {"trackName":"zootopia"}, {"country":"US"}, {"kind":"movie"} contains in all the indexes of the array 
   - Test if array length is equal to limit value: 10.
   - Assert all the condition. If even one condition fails, report failure
   - Assert if true on each iteration. If false report failure.
  Expected : Test Passed
